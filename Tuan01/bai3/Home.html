  <h1>Fiddler on the Roof JR.</h1>
  <p>
    Thanks to everyone who made <strong>Fiddler on the Roof Jr.</strong> such a smashing success!
    After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off.
    I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.

  <p>
    I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the production.
    Please feel free to download the files from the Web site.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Scrapbooking is the practice of combining photos, memorabilia, and stories in an album,
          preserving memories for future generations. In recent years, scrapbooking has become a
          $300 million dollar industry as the public has discovered the joys of creating albums for
          families and friends. Online Scrapbooks is here to help you with all of your scrapbooking needs.

          <ul>

        <p>
          Scrapbook albums have existed since the beginning of photography. However, the sad fact
          is that photographs and most printed material are not permanent: they will fade and yellow
          with age. Scrapbookers of today are aware of these problems, and the industry is providing
          remedies to minimize deterioration.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the best results, avoid using materials with high acid content which can cause photos
          and paper to deteriorate. Another thing to avoid is lignin, a material that is the bonding
          element in wood fibers. Over time, paper with lignin will become yellow and brittle, so you
          should only use lignin-free products.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your albums should contain page protectors to shield the pages from smudges, oil, and dirt
          that can be transferred from your hands. You should never use albums with sticky "magnetic"
          pages. The sticky substance will be transferred to the photo and backing paper causing
          deterioration. Never crop Polaroid® photos: they will curl and fall apart. Mount all
          memorabilia on acid-free cardstock paper, and photocopy all newspaper clippings on
          acid-free paper.
        </p>
